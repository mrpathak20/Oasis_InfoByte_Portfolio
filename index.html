        <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>Priyanshu Pathak</span></h1>
        <p>
            Hi there! I am a computer science student with a passion for technology and innovation. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge.

            My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [GITA Autonomus College], where I gained expertise in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I also have experience in web development, database design, and software engineering.
            
            During my studies, I participated in several hackathons and coding competitions, where I collaborated with other students to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems. These experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.
            
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also completed several internships in the tech industry. During these internships, I worked on projects such as developing mobile applications, improving website functionality, and creating machine learning models. These experiences have given me hands-on experience and have taught me how to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical problems.
            
            Apart from my technical skills, I also possess strong interpersonal skills and am an effective communicator. I believe in building strong relationships with my colleagues and working together to achieve common goals.
            
            Looking ahead, I am excited to continue learning and growing in the tech industry. I am always seeking new opportunities to expand my skill set and take on new challenges. If you are interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to reach out to me!
